  <b>Ans</b>: <p>The key difference between the flexbox and css grid layout models lies in their layout stratgies and how to handle the arrangement of elements;</p>

    <P><b>Flexbox</b> is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts,focusing on distributing space and aligning items along a single axis .</P>


    <P><b>CSS Grid </b> is designed for two-dimensional layouts,allowing you to define both rows and columns.it creates a grid of cells where content can be placed in any cell or span across multiple cells.</P>
